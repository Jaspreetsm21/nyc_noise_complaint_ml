# [2. Data Cleaning](https://github.com/Jaspreetsm21/Yelp_Restaurants_Reviews_Analysis/blob/master/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)

After downloading the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our analysis. I had to deal with missing values some of them were dealt with manually and others such as missing postcode I filled in the missing values with London central postcode because it was irrelevant to our analysis.

- Changing the Price column to object type and replacing the values from (Unknown,£,££,£££,££££) to (0,1,2,3,4) as it states the price of the restaurants.
