# NYC Noise Complaints 2016: Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on Noise complaints that were collected in 2016 and indicate ongoing party in a given neighborhood.I wused python to analyse the data.

1 - Load the data on to Python and clean the data

2 - Carried out EDA on 10k+ Restaurants and finding popular restaurants by reviews and ratings.

4 - Created a Dashboard inside Tableau that allows users to explore restaurants across London.

# Code and Resources Used

**Python Version**: 3.7

**Packages**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn,json

**API Resource**: https://github.com/justinmlam/foodcouver/blob/master/gather_data.ipynb  (API Example)


# [2. Data Cleaning](https://github.com/Jaspreetsm21/Yelp_Restaurants_Reviews_Analysis/blob/master/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)

After downloading the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our analysis. I had to deal with missing values some of them were dealt with manually and others such as missing postcode I filled in the missing values with London central postcode because it was irrelevant to our analysis.

- Changing the Price column to object type and replacing the values from (Unknown,£,££,£££,££££) to (0,1,2,3,4) as it states the price of the restaurants.
